TODOs:

- [ ] Order videos by freshness/quality/popularity, better videos go higher
- [ ] Parse video description as markdown
- [ ] Improve share buttons (use native sharing if available)
- [ ] Use navigator.sendBeacon for GA if available
- [ ] Sanity check for content in generate.ts to avoid lots of broken pages
- [ ] Download images/video data from live site if available instead of crawling
- [ ] Tag pages, tag links, add tags to videos
- [ ] Lyrics page
- [ ] After build test if sitemap.xml is present
- [ ] Skip to link (e.g. skip to 55:03 where Ode to Joy begins)
- [ ] Like / clap / Enjoyed button for videos
